Web applications have become the cornerstone of the modern Internet.

This course will give you a ground-up introduction to fundamental networking and Internet principles, full-stack web application development, databases, and web security.

We are continually developing this course to ensure it remains up-to-date with current technologies and industry trends, and hope that the skills and knowledge you take away will prove useful throughout your studies and careers.

We look forward to meeting you and seeing all the different web applications that you produce this semester.
